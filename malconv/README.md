If you use the pre-trained weights or code in your work, we also ask that you please cite [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04637.pdf) for the implementation of MalConv, as it differs in a few subtle ways from the original.

## Can I use this code to train MalConv on my own dataset?
The code provided is instructional and nonfunctional.  With a few minor changes, it can be made functional.  In particular, you must provide a URL to fetch file contents by sha256 hash.

## How does this MalConv model differ from that of Raff et al.?
 * Our model was trained on binary files from labeled samples in the EMBER training set.
 * The original paper used `batch_size = 256` and `SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, decay=UNDISCLOSED, nesterov=True )`.  We used
 `decay=1e-3` and `batch_size=100`.
 * It is unknown whether the original paper used a special symbol for padding.
 * The paper allowed for up to 2MB malware sizes, we use 1MB because of memory limits on a commonly-used Titan X.
